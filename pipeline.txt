#Data Ingestion
1.we will define variable in our constant file
2.after creating variable we will connect in config file
3.after completing both steps we will start our data ingestion pipeline

#Data Transformation
1.we will define variable in our constant file
2.after creating variable we will connect in config file
3.after completing both steps we will start our data transformation pipeline
4.if required we will use utils file

#Model Training 
1.we will define variable in our constant file
2.after creating variable we will connect in config file
3.after completing both steps we will start our Model Training pipeline 
4.if required we will use utils function

#Batch Prediction
1.we will define variable in our constant file
2.after creating variable we will connect in config file
3.after completing both steps we will start our Batch Prediction
4.if required we will use utils function

#Training pipeline
1. define training pipeline in pipeline folder for train model

#Prediction Pipeline 
1. define prediction pipeline for make prediction on new data

#Application
1.connect all the pipeline in app.py for creating a user friendly interface
